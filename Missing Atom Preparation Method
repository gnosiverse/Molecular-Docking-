Procedure :
Download Modeller from https://salilab.org/modeller/download_installation.html

Create a file into pc named repair and keep those file are contaning missing residues
 open pymol then put the file 
then click S to select all residue here you will be seeing Amino acids previously you will see some 00000000000000000000000
then there missing between amino acids number such as 131----137 here 5 residue missing in Sumbol it will be seen as AHDRRF-----ASJSFHFS
NOW   you are confirmed where those residues are missing. Also open the PDB file in the notepad you will those residue missing here indicated in latter 

in the google search by the receptor name RCSB PDB click on it 
download in the fasta format
open that file in to the note pad then you will those component are withing that were written 

go to the Salilab.orgv > documentation >Wiki> Search > Missing residue > you will see a code :

from modeller import *
# Get the sequence of the 1qg8 PDB file, and write to an alignment file
code = '1qg8'                                                                                   
e = Environ()
m = Model(e, file=code)
aln = Alignment(e)
aln.append_model(m, align_codes=code)
aln.write(file=code+'.seq')
 [Here  '1qg8'    is the sample receptor where residue missing]

Now  create a python file named script1.py in the repair folder paste the code
based on the pdb file you will have to put the name in the code = 'replaced by 1qg8'   

click in the right three dot option in the folder and uncheck the Hide extensions for know file
then you will see .txt besides the script1.py cut that and same only script1.py

now find the Modeller application file  > bin > repair. this repair file will be empty you have to paste every file fom  the previous repair file 

search on pc modeller command promt now run as adminstration
